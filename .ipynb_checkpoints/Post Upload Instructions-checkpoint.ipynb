    "# How to upload a post\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to uploading a post. First, format post as a markdown file with YAML front matter. Second, \"jekyll\" markdown file to create site ready post.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format: export to markdown\n",
    "Posts are stored in your 'Applied-Quantum-Computing.github.io/_posts' folder as markdown files (.md). Be sure to pull the repo before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export:\n",
    "1. Export the jupyter notebook you want to be a post as a markdown file\n",
    "    * start up the jupyter notebook, go to file, download as, then markdown\n",
    "2. Name the markdown file with the format yyyy-mm-dd-title (the title can contain spaces)\n",
    "3. Check the markdown file's special casing is generated with html (e.g. < strong > for bold) tags rather than markdown short cuts (e.g. \\*\\*bold\\*\\* for bold)\n",
    "4. Check urls still make sense and are tied to other site articles.\n",
    "5. When you exported the notebook to a markdown file, all plots and images should have also been exported as pngs in the same folder as the markdown file. Move these files to the folder 'Applied-Quantum-Computing.github.io/assets/images/'. In the markdown file, replace ```![png](auto_generated_filename.png)``` with ```![png](/assets/images/auto_generated_filename.png)``` for each image. Note, the png filenames are auto generated, but they need to be unique in the assets folder, so you may need to rename them to avoid filename conflicts.\n",
